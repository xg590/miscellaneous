### Pixel -- Pixel -- Call ended instantly
* My Pixel recently cannot dial a number in Red Pocket network but is able to send/receive SMS and surf the network, which seems like a network problem.
* I heard Red Pocket is loosing 3G network support so maybe that is the problem?
* The Pixel is running Android 12 and it does have the option to choose a preferred network type.
* Then I dial a special number *#*#4636#*#* then I can access a hidden menu.
* Choose the phone information and the ensuing page has an option of choosing the network type. 
* On default my Pixel preferred NR (5G) but I choose LTE Only. Voila! I can dial other numbers. 
* I suspect my Pixel is using VoLTE only.
